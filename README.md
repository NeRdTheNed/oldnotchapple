# Old Notch Apples

## Features
Old Notch Apples is a mod that brings back the overpowered nature of pre-1.9 Enchanted Golden apple.

It adds:
1. The old effects.
1. The old recipe.
1. The achivement (Now in form of an "challenge" advancement, which is a child of Stone Age).

That's it! Very simple mod.
